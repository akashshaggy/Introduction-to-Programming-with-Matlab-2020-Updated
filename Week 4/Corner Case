%Write a function called corners that takes a matrix as input argument and returns four outputs :
%the elements at its four corners in this order: top_left, top_right, bottom_left and bottom_right. 
%(Note that loops and if-statements are neither necessary nor allowed as we have not covered them yet.) 



function [top_left,top_right,bottom_left,bottom_right] = corners(A)
top_left = A(1,1)
top_right = A(1,end)
bottom_left = A(end,1)
bottom_right = A(end,end)
end
